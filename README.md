BIOS-and-HDD-Key-code-Calculator
================================

This program calculates the key codes of HDD and BIOS systems of ACER and Sony VAIO laptops. 
This program was created in C++ programming language and it is desingned to calculate the key-codes of BIOS nad HDD systems
by knowing the license numbers of ACER and Sony VAIO laptops. License number for each laptop is aboslutely unique. I
just figured out that algorithms by different internet sources and tried my program for 3 ACER and 2 Sony VAIO laptops and 
that worked perfectly. The program works like this.
ACER license numbers consists of 8 digits and Sony VAIO license numbers consists of 7 digits. 
THe interesting part of the decryption was that key codes also have the same corresponind length.
So if the first number of ACER' laptops' license number is # the first number of the key-code is associated to that number
(for instance if the first number of license number is 1, the first number of key code is always 0).
