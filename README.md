BIOS-and-HDD-Key-code-Calculator
================================


   When a laptop is locked with password, a checksum of that password is stored to a so-called FlashROM - this is a chip on the mainboard of the device which also contains the BIOS code and other settings, e.g. memory timings. For most brands, this checksum is displayed after entering an invalid password for the third time.                                         
   The dramatic 'System Disabled' message is just scare tactics: when you remove all power from the laptop and reboot it, it will work just as before. From such a checksum (also called "hash"), valid passwords can be found by means of brute-forcing. The bypass mechanisms of other vendors work by showing a number to the user from which a master password can be derived. This password is usually a sequence of numbers generated randomly.

   This program generates and calculates the key codes of HDD and BIOS systems of ACER and Sony VAIO laptops according to their license numbers. Licesne numbers for each laptop is absolutely unique and "BIOS and HDD Key code Calculator" helps easily to figure out corresponding key codes. The algorithm was figured out by multiple-testing and collecting data from different Internet sources. The program is written in C++ programming language.

Reminder<< #ACER license numbers consist of 8 digits and Sony VAIO license numbers consist of 7 digits. All digits are only numbers.
